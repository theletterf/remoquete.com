&#8211; Masterful? &#8211; Kallistus asked.

&#8211; It tell me &#8211; Patágoras answered. 

&#8211; Masterful, why we spoke of a so rare and imperfect form? This is not normal. 

&#8211; We spoke thus because to our creator it the pot has gone away and has used the [translator of Google][1]. &#8211; Patágoras with patience said. 

&#8211; Why it has made such thing? &#8211; the disciple asked. 

&#8211; For mostraros that, like translators, the machines give pain. &#8211; Patágoras with dryness replaced. 

Both followed their way towards the Pireo.
