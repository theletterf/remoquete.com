Sometimes there&#8217;s no story to tell; you just sit down and stare at the fire.

And that&#8217;s perfectly fine. There&#8217;s no need to force a story out of everything.

Let things be. Show them. Let people guess their origin. And shut up.

Existence has a haunting quality of its own; most things exist without a reason.

Preserve those pockets of mystery.
